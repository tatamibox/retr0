UI: 

- Homepage with navbar, category displays, and product displays
- Inspiration from Grailed or Depop

Profiles: 
- Auth done completely through Firebase
- Profile attributes will be done through MongoDB (Comments, posts, products, sales, etc.)
- A user page that displays their current listed items, transaction reviews, likes, and comments

Products:
- Product pages that have item photos, posted dates, and tagged categories COMPLETE :)
- Stripe API // in progress
- Product info will be directly managed on MongoDB COMPLETE :)
- Comments on the product page which has upvotes and downvotes --> 50%, need to add the ability to upvote and downvote
- Ability for a user to post a product they are selling --> { CONSTRAINTS: If a user has less than 5 verified sales,
                                                                which are verified by a moderator on the site, posts must be verified. After that they are allowed to post freely}
^^^ --- this idea has been removed, just need to add a delete option for the users who own the post and those who moderate the site
therefore any inappropriate posts would be able to be removed by moderation / those who have the correct permissions on their account
