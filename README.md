## Project Summary

retr0 is a fully-functional eCommerce website (no payment API integrated currently) which focuses around the buying & selling of vintage fashion goods. Similar to Depop and Grailed, retr0 allows users to post their own products, comment on other products, and add desired products to their own cart. 

Things I tried out in this project include adding a verified user system, which gives certain accounts perks and special username attributes sitewide. useContext hooks also proved to be useful for me in this project, allowing user information to be utilized in different parts of the website.
